# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to [manuel@christlieb.eu](mailto:manuel@christlieb.eu).
Please include the affected package version, a description of the impact, and reproduction
steps or a minimal proof of concept. Remove credentials, signing keys, tokens, and personal
data from reports. Do not open a public issue or pull request containing vulnerability details
before a fix and disclosure have been coordinated.

## Supported Versions

Before the first tagged release, security fixes target `main`. After release, only the latest
published release receives security fixes. Reports about any version are welcome; include
whether the issue also affects the latest release if you can verify it. Older releases do not
receive backported fixes.

The supported runtime is PHP 8.5 with Laravel 13 and PostgreSQL 16.

## Compatibility Before 1.0

During `0.x`, minor releases may include breaking changes. Patch releases are intended to
preserve compatibility; a security fix may require a breaking change, which will be identified
in the release notes. Review release notes and test your integration before upgrading.
